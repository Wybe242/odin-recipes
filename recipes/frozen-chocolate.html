      <h1>Forzen Hershey Bar</h1>

      <p>Frozen Hershey bars: a bold reinvention of classic confectionery, where smooth milk chocolate is transformed into a crisp, glacial indulgence that shatters expectations (and possibly molars). It’s the dessert equivalent of a plot twist—simple, dramatic, and undeniably delicious.</p>
      <h2>Recipe</h2>

      <p>Prep Time: 10 seconds</p>
      <p>Freeze Time: As long as your willpower holds out (estimated: 15 minutes)</p>
      
      <h3>Ingridents</h3>

      <ul>
	  <li>1 Hershey bar (or 7, who are we kidding)</li>
	  <li>A freezer that hasn’t turned into a popsicle graveyard</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>

      <ol>
	  <li>Unwrap the Hershey bar with the reverence of opening an ancient treasure.</li>
	  <li>Place it gently in the freezer like you're putting a baby to bed—except colder and more delicious.</li>
	  <li>Wait patiently. Or impatiently. Stare through the freezer window if necessary.</li>
	  <li>Remove when rock-solid and bite into it like you’ve got dental insurance.</li>
	  <li>Experience the rich, frozen snap of chocolate while wondering why this isn’t a Michelin-starred dessert.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If it breaks a tooth, that’s just chocolate reminding you who's boss.</p>
